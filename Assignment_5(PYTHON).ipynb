    "1. Encapsulation: \\\n",
    "Encapsulation is the idea of grouping together into a single unit, called a class, the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data. It entails limiting direct access to parts of an object's components in order to manage access to and modification of data as well as to assist prevent unwanted interference. The idea of access levels, such as public, private, and protected, which control how the internal components of a class may be interacted with from outside, is also made possible by encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: \\\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of concentrating on an object's key characteristics while disregarding its minor elements. Abstraction in programming is accomplished via classes and objects. A class offers a blueprint with properties and methods that reflect an actual thing or idea in the real world. By giving a streamlined perspective of things and their relationships, abstraction aids in managing complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: \\\n",
    "A new class (subclass or derived class) can inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class) through the process of inheritance. It encourages the development of hierarchical links between classes and the reuse of code. The subclass can also add its own particular features and methods in addition to inheriting the traits of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: \\\n",
    "The ability of several classes to be considered as instances of a single superclass is referred to as polymorphism. This enables the interchangeability of objects of diverse types via a common interface. Dynamic binding, where the specific method implementation is decided at runtime based on the actual type of the object, is made possible by polymorphism, which increases the code's flexibility and adaptability."
