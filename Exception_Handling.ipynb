    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, the program doesn't proceed as usual; instead, it jumps to a specific section of code called an \"exception handler\" or \"exception block\" that can handle or respond to the exceptional situation. This helps in gracefully managing errors and preventing crashes."

    "3. Code Readability: Custom exceptions add semantic meaning to your code. When you see a custom exception being raised or caught, it's immediately clear what kind of error is being addressed.\n",

    "4. Consistency: When multiple parts of your codebase need to raise similar errors, using custom exceptions ensures that these errors are consistent in terms of structure and behavior.\n",
