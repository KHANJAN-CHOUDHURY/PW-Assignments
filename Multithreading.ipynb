    "Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process.

Multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently, potentially improving overall program performance and responsiveness.\n",

However, multithreading can still be useful for IO-bound tasks (where threads spend a lot of time waiting for external resources) and for improving concurrency in certain situations"

    "Deadlocks are situations that occur in concurrent programming when two or more threads or processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource held by another. In other words, the threads or processes are stuck in a circular waiting state, where none of them can make progress. Deadlocks can lead to a program becoming unresponsive or stuck indefinitely, requiring intervention to resolve the situation."
